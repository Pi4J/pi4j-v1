## KNOWN ISSUES

2018-04-23 :: 1.2-SNAPSHOT

  *  As of 2018-04-23, We have removed support for the Pi4J native library statically compiled against WiringPi.
     for the Raspberry Pi platform.  You must now have WiringPi installed on your target Raspberry Pi system 
     separately from Pi4J.  WiringPi is now included be default in the latest Raspbian builds.  We made this change
     in part because the WiringPi project now requests no static linking and because it would cause Pi4J to fail 
     on newer platforms when we were not able to get a new build released in a reasonable and timely manner.  This 
     change should be of a minimal negative impact now that WiringPi is included with the OS and users will benefit
     from being able to take advantage of newer WirinPi builds without depending on a new Pi4J build. 

2016-07-26 :: 1.1

  *  On the Raspberry Pi Model 3B the hardware-based serial/UART device `/dev/ttyAMA0` has been re-purposed to   
     communicate with the the built-in Bluetooth modem and is no longer mapped to the serial RX/TX pins on the GPIO 
     header.  Instead, a new serial port "/dev/ttyS0" has been provided which is implemented with a software-based UART 
     (miniUART).  This software-based UART ("/dev/ttyS0") does not support PARITY and some have experienced some 
     stability issues using this port at higher speeds.  If you don't need the Bluetooth modem functionality, you can 
     disable the BT modem and configure the RPi to use a device-tree overlay to re-map the hardware-based serial UART
     ("/dev/ttyAMA0") back to the GPIO header pins for TX/RX.  See the instructions on this page for details on how to 
     configure the device-tree overlay and disable the bluetooth modem/service: 
     https://openenergymonitor.org/emon/node/12311

  *  The Odroid C1/C1+/C2 only permits up to four GPIO pins to be configured with edge detection for both "rising"
     and "falling" edges (a.k.a., "both"). Thus, you can only use a maximum of four GPIO input pins with listener
     events.  You can, however, implement a polling strategy to read a pin state if you need more than 4 input pins.
    (see: https://github.com/Pi4J/pi4j/issues/229 & http://odroid.com/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=en:c1_hardware_irq)

  *  PWM is not supported in the Hardkernel Odroid WiringPi port.  Thus PWM is not currently supported by Pi4J for 
     the Odroid boards (C1/C1+/C2). There is no PWM function on the 30pin GPIO header on the XU3/XU4.   
    (see: https://github.com/Pi4J/pi4j/issues/229)

  *  Support for OrangePi and Synovoip BPI platforms is considered experimental and has had limited testing.  Not 
     all Pi4J features may be supported and/or working properly.
