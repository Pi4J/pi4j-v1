   *  Modified build script to support concurrent soft-float and hard-float native library builds
   *  Modified build script to include pulling wiringPi sources and compiling when building native library
   *  Added power controller device interface, base impl, and reference impl
   *  Added GpioController.provisionXXXPin methods that allow name to be optional
   *  Relocated project downloads location to google code site; github deprecated downloads.
   *  Added Google Groups discussion forum to project docs. 
   *  Added getTag() and setTag() to GpioPin interface and impl. 
   *  Added TemperatureConversion utility. 
   *  Added optional blocking argument to GpioPin pulse method to support blocking pulse invocations 

2012-10-22 :: 0.0.3-SNAPSHOT
 
   *  Refactored Gpio interfaces to permit extensible GpioProviders for add-on devices.
   *  Refactored Gpio interfaces to separate digital, analog, and PWM types of input and output pins.
   *  Added support for analog GPIO pins (interfaces, methods and events). 
   *  Added Olimex AVR-IO-M16 GpioProvider to serve as an example of extending a new GpioProvider for GPIO expansion. 
   *  Added Olimex AVR-IO-M16 sources for ARV micro-controller.
   *  Removed setDirection() from GpioPin; embedded this functionality into existing setMode() method.  Eliminating duplication.
   *  Removed old test programs from pi4j-core and moved wiringPi examples to pi4j-example project.  
   *  Added support for I2C communication.
   *  Added blink() methods for GPIO pins


2012-09-23 :: 0.0.2-SNAPSHOT
 
   *  Refactored Gpio interface to permit methods using Pin argument to function without requiring a GpioPin to first be provisioned
   *  Added OSGi manifest 
   *  Optimized GPIO interrupt thread handling to only be created if GpioPin listeners or triggers have been registered.
   *  Now disabling/stopping GPIO interrupt native thread monitoring if all GpioPin listeners or triggers are unregistered.
   *  Added additional convenience methods in GpioPin interface for evaluating state, direction, resistance, mode, etc. 
   *  There were two Gpio classes; renamed one to GpioController to avoid confusion.
   *  Added OSGi service project to export Pi4J GPIO as an OSGi service.  


2012-09-19 :: 0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
 
   *  Initial ALPHA release
