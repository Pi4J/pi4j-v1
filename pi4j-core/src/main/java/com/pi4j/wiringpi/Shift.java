/**
 * <h1>WiringPi Shift Library</h1>
 *
 * <p>
 * WiringPi includes a shift library which more or less mimics the one in the Arduino system. This
 * allows you to shift 8-bit data values out of the Pi, or into the Pi from devices such as
 * shift-registers (e.g. 74,595) and so-on, although it can also be used in some bit-banging
 * scenarios.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Before using the Pi4J library, you need to ensure that the Java VM in configured with access to
 * the following system libraries:
 * <ul>
 * <li>pi4j</li>
 * <li>wiringPi</li>
 * </ul>
 * <blockquote> This library depends on the wiringPi native system library.</br> (developed by
 * Gordon Henderson @ <a href="http://wiringpi.com">http://wiringpi.com</a>)
 * </blockquote>
