/**
 * <p>
 * WiringPi includes a library which can make it easier to use the Raspberry Pi’s on-board I2C interface.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Before you can use the I2C interface, you may need to use the gpio utility to load the I2C drivers into the kernel:
 *  > gpio load i2c
 *
 * If you need a baud rate other than the default 100Kbps, then you can supply this on the command-line:
 *  > gpio load i2c 1000
 *
 * will set the baud rate to 1000Kbps – ie. 1,000,000 bps. (K here is times 1000) *
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <blockquote> This library depends on the wiringPi native system library.</br> (developed by
 * Gordon Henderson @ <a href="http://wiringpi.com/">http://wiringpi.com/</a>)

     * and you can use the i2cdetect program to find this out. wiringPiI2CSetup() will work out which revision
     * Raspberry Pi you have and open the appropriate device in /dev.
