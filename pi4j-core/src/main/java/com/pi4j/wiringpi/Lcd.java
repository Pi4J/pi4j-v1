/**
 * <p>
 * Part of wiringPi is a library to allow access to parallel interface LCD displays (Those that use
 * the popular Hitachi HD44780U or compatible controllers)
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The library is simple to use in your own programs, however wiring the displays up may be
 * challenging, so do take care. It is possible to wire up more than one display! In 8-bit mode, the
 * first display needs 10 GPIO pins and each additional display needs just one more pin, so with a
 * maximum of 17 GPIO pins, that's 8 displays. If you move to using a 4-bit interface (trivial in
 * the code), then it's 4 more displays and 12 LCDs! However I suspect the rest of the wiring might be
 * somewhat challenging. Wiring is described at the end of the this page.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The LCD display can be either a 5V display or a 3,3v display, however if we are using a 5V
 * display then we must make absolutely sure the display can never write data back to the Raspberry
 * Pi, otherwise it will present 5V on the Pi's GPIO pins which will not be good. At best you'll
 * destroy the pin drivers, at worst you'll destroy your Pi.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * So make sure you always connect the R/W pin on the display to ground to force the display to be
 * read-only to the host.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Before using the Pi4J library, you need to ensure that the Java VM in configured with access to
 * the following system libraries:
 * <ul>
 * <li>pi4j</li>
 * <li>wiringPi</li>
 * </ul>
 * <blockquote> This library depends on the wiringPi native system library.</br> (developed by
 * Gordon Henderson @ <a href="http://wiringpi.com/">http://wiringpi.com/</a>)
 * </blockquote>

     * First, you need to initialize wiringPi in the way you want to. The LCD library will call
     * pinMode functions, but these are ignored if you have already set the modes using the gpio

     * functions.

     * <p>
     * Rows and cols are the rows and columns on the display (e.g. 2, 16 or 4,20). Bits is the
     * number of bits wide on the interface (4 or 8). The rs and strb represent the pin numbers of
     * the displays RS pin and Strobe (E) pin. The parameters d0 through d7 are the pin numbers of
     * the 8 data pins connected from the Pi to the display. Only the first 4 are used if you are
     * running the display in 4-bit mode.
     * </p>
     *
     * <p>
     * The pin numbers will be either wiringPi pin numbers of GPIO pin numbers depending on which
     * wiringPiSetup function you used.
