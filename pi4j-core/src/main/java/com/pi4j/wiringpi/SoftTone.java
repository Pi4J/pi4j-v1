/**
 * <p>
 * WiringPi includes a software-driven sound handler capable of outputting a simple tone/square wave signal on any of
 * the Raspberry Pi’s GPIO pins.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * There are some limitations… To maintain a low CPU usage, the minimum pulse width is 100μS. That gives a maximum
 * frequency of  1/0.0002 = 5000Hz.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Also note that while the routines run themselves at a higher and real-time priority, Linux can still affect the
 * accuracy of the generated tone.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * However, within these limitations, simple tones on a high impedance speaker or piezo sounder is possible.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * NOTES:  - Each pin activated in softTone mode uses approximately 0.5% of the CPU.
           - You need to keep your program running to maintain the sound output!
 * <blockquote> This library depends on the wiringPi native system library.</br> (developed by
 * Gordon Henderson @ <a href="http://wiringpi.com/">http://wiringpi.com/</a>)
