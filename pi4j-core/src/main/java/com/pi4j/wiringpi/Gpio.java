/**
 * <[>WiringPi GPIO Control</[>
 *
 * <p>
 * Some of the functions in the WiringPi library are designed to mimic those in the Arduino Wiring
 * system. There are relatively easy to use and should present no problems for anyone used to the
 * Arduino system, or C programming in-general.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The main difference is that unlike the Arduino system, the main loop of the program is not
 * provided for you and you need to write it yourself. This is often desirable in a Linux system
 * anyway as it can give you access to command-line arguments and so on. See the examples page for
 * some simple examples and a Makefile to use.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Before using the Pi4J library, you need to ensure that the Java VM in configured with access to
 * the following system libraries:
 * <ul>
 * <li>pi4j</li>
 * <li>wiringPi</li>
 * </ul>
 * <blockquote> This library depends on the wiringPi native system library.</br> (developed by
 * Gordon Henderson @ <a href="http://wiringpi.com/">http://wiringpi.com/</a>)
 * </blockquote>

     * With a newer kernel patched with the GPIO interrupt handling code, you can now wait for an
     * interrupt in your program. This frees up the processor to do other tasks while you're waiting
     * for that interrupt. The GPIO can be set to interrupt on a rising, falling or both edges of
     * the incoming signal.
     * </p>
     * <p> <b> int waitForInterrupt (int pin, int timeOut) </b> </p>
     *
     * <p>
     * When called, it will wait for an interrupt event to happen on that pin and your program will
     * be stalled. The timeOut parameter is given in milliseconds, or can be -1 which means to wait
     * forever.
     * </p>
     *
     * <p>
     * Before you call waitForInterrupt, you must first initialize the GPIO pin and at present the
     * only way to do this is to use the gpio program, either in a script, or using the system()
     * call from inside your program.
     * </p>
     *
     * <p>
     * e.g. We want to wait for a falling-edge interrupt on GPIO pin 0, so to setup the hardware, we
     * need to run:
     *
     * <pre>
     * gpio edge 0 falling
     * </pre>
     *
     * </p>
     *
     * @deprecated Note: Jan 2013: The waitForInterrupt() function is deprecated – you should use the newer
     *             and easier to use wiringPiISR() function.

     *            disable the timeout.

     * This function registers a function to received interrupts on the specified pin. The edgeType parameter is either
     * INT_EDGE_FALLING, INT_EDGE_RISING, INT_EDGE_BOTH or INT_EDGE_SETUP. If it is INT_EDGE_SETUP then no
     * initialisation of the pin will happen – it’s assumed that you have already setup the pin elsewhere
     * (e.g. with the gpio program), but if you specify one of the other types, then the pin will be exported and
     * initialised as specified. This is accomplished via a suitable call to the gpio utility program, so it need to
     * be available
     * </p>
     *
     * <p>
     * The pin number is supplied in the current mode – native wiringPi, BCM_GPIO, physical or Sys modes.

     * <p>
     * This function will work in any mode, and does not need root privileges to work.
     * </p>
     *
     * <p>
     * The function will be called when the interrupt triggers. When it is triggered, it’s cleared in the dispatcher
     * before calling your function, so if a subsequent interrupt fires before you finish your handler, then it won’t
     * be missed. (However it can only track one more interrupt, if more than one interrupt fires while one is being
     * handled then they will be ignored)
     * </p>
     *
     * <p>
     * This function is run at a high priority (if the program is run using sudo, or as root) and executes
     * concurrently with the main program. It has full access to all the global variables, open file handles
     * and so on.
