/**
 * <[>WiringPi GPIO Control</[>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Some of the functions in the WiringPi library are designed to mimic those in the Arduino Wiring
 * system. There are relatively easy to use and should present no problems for anyone used to the
 * Arduino system, or C programming in-general.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The main difference is that unlike the Arduino system, the main loop of the program is not
 * provided for you and you need to write it yourself. This is often desirable in a Linux system
 * anyway as it can give you access to command-line arguments and so on. See the examples page for
 * some simple examples and a Makefile to use.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Before using the Pi4J library, you need to ensure that the Java VM in configured with access to
 * the following system libraries:
 * <ul>
 * <li>pi4j</li>
 * <li>wiringPi</li>
 * </ul>
 * <blockquote> This library depends on the wiringPi native system library.</br> (developed by
 * Gordon Henderson @ <a href="https://projects.drogon.net/">https://projects.drogon.net/</a>)
