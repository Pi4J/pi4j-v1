/**
 * <p>
 * The Gertboard has an on-board Digital to Analog (DAC) converter and an Analog to Digital (ADC)
 * converters. These are connected via the SPI bus back to the Raspberry Pi host.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Each of the DAC and ADC chips has 2 channels.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The DAC has a resolution of 8 bits and produces an output voltage between 0 and 2.047 volts, the
 * ADC has a resolution of 10 bits and can take an input voltage between 0 and 3.3 volts.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Part of the wiringPi library includes code to setup and drive these chips in an easy to use
 * manner.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * To use in a program, first you need to make sure that the 5 SPI jumpers are present on the
 * Gertboard (there are 7 in total, 5 for the SPI, 2 to connect the serial to the ATmega), the
 * photo below shows all 7 jumpers in-place.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Before using the Pi4J library, you need to ensure that the Java VM in configured with access to
 * the following system libraries:
 * <ul>
 * <li>pi4j</li>
 * <li>wiringPi</li>
 * </ul>
 * <blockquote> This library depends on the wiringPi native system library.</br> (developed by
 * Gordon Henderson @ <a href="http://wiringpi.com/">http://wiringpi.com/</a>)
 * </blockquote>
