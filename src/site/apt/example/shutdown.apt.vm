GPIO Shutdown using Pi4J.

  If is highly likely that your program should return the GPIO pins states to a known fixed state any time the user application is exited.  
  The following example demonstrates how to configure the shutdown behavior that will be applied to the GPIO pins when the Java application terminates.

* Source Code
  
  The source code for this example is included in the github repository:\
  {{https://github.com/Pi4J/pi4j/tree/master/pi4j-example/src/main/java/ShutdownGpioExample.java}}

%{snippet|id=shutdown-gpio-snippet|file=pi4j-example/src/main/java/ShutdownGpioExample.java}

* JavaDoc

  The following JavaDoc links are the primary interfaces used to perform automated shutdown for the Pi's GPIO pins:

* Download
  
  First, copy the <ShutdownGpioExample.java> source file to a directory on the RaspberryPi.\
  You can use the following command on the Pi's console or SSH terminal to download the example source file directly to your Pi:
  
  <<<wget https://raw.github.com/Pi4J/pi4j/master/pi4j-example/src/main/java/ShutdownGpioExample.java>>>

  If you have not already downloaded the Pi4J library JAR to the RaspberryPi, then you can use the following command on the Pi's console or SSH terminal to download the Pi4J JAR file.

  <<<wget https://github.com/downloads/Pi4J/pi4j/pi4j-core-${project.version}.jar>>>

* Compile
  
  Next, use the following command to compile this example program:
  
  <<<javac -cp pi4j-core-${project.version}.jar -d . ShutdownGpioExample.java>>>
  
* Execute
  
  The following command will run this example program:
  
  <<<sudo java -classpath .:pi4j-core-${project.version}.jar ShutdownGpioExample>>>
  
* Output

  You should see the attached LED perform as follows:

  Turn ON

[../images/pinoff.png] 
  
  Turn OFF after 10 seconds when the program automatically exists.\
  Turn OFF if the user terminates the program using CTRL-C prior to the 10 second timeout.
