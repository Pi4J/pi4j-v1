Welcome to Pi4J!

  This project is intended to provide a friendly object-oriented I/O API and implementation libraries for Java
  Programmers to access the full I/O capabilities of the Raspberry Pi platform.
  This project abstracts the low-level native integration and interrupt monitoring to enable Java programmers to focus
  on implementing their application business logic.

  [2020-01-11]

  Version 1.3 has been released and is now available for download. ({{{./download.html}Downloads}} | {{{./install.html}Installation}})

  Latest Development Updates:

    * Added support for {{{./pins/model-4b-rev1.html}Raspberry Pi 4B}}

    * Added support for {{{./pins/model-400-rev1.html}Raspberry Pi 400}}

    * Added support for {{{./pins/model-cm4-rev1.html}Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4}}

    * Various improvements and bug fixes listed here: {{{https://github.com/Pi4J/pi4j/milestone/10?closed=1}GitHub Issues (v1.3)}}

   Additional details can be found in the project's {{{https://github.com/Pi4J/pi4j/blob/master/README.md}README}}.

* Project Status

  Please note that the Version 1.x codebase for this project is no longer being actively developed.  The Version 1.x
  codebase will only be maintained and updated for major bug fixes. This codebase has been largely stable for several
  years and is compatible across a wide variety of Raspberry Pi SoCs and you are welcome to continue using it. However,
  for new projects, it is highly recommended to migrate to the {{{https://v2.pi4j.com/}Pi4J Version 2.x}} codebase.

  Bug fixes are maintained in the '{{{https://github.com/Pi4J/pi4j/tree/master}master}}' branch in
  the Pi4J GitHub repository and SNAPSHOT builds are published in the {{{./download.html#Maven_Repository}Sonatype OSS repository}}.

  Visit the {{{./download.html}Downloads}} page to download the latest Pi4J v1.x library builds.

* Prerequisites

  * {{{https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html}Java 8 JRE/JDK}} - The Java 8 runtime
  environment must be installed and configured on your SoC platform.

  * {{{https://github.com/WiringPi/WiringPi}WiringPi}} - The original WiringPi library has been
  **{{{http://wiringpi.com/wiringpi-deprecated/}DEPRECATED}}** and is no longer maintained.  To support RaspberryPi
  4B/400 and newer systems you must install the latest *unofficial* WiringPi version which is maintained
  here: {{https://github.com/WiringPi/WiringPi}}. (As of 2021-01-12, this is version 2.60.)
