Welcome to Pi4J!

  This project is intended to provide a friendly object-oriented I/O API and implementation libraries for Java
  Programmers to access the full I/O capabilities of the Raspberry Pi platform.
  This project abstracts the low-level native integration and interrupt monitoring to enable Java programmers to focus
  on implementing their application business logic.

  [2020-01-21]

  Starting with the Pi4J 1.4 builds, the Pi4J project is prioritizing focus
  on providing Java programs access, control and communication with the core
  I/O capabilities of the Raspberry Pi platform.  Earlier versions of Pi4J
  were perhaps too ambitious in scope and that led to significant project
  bloat to the point that the project was becoming unsustainable.  The goal
  moving forward is to limit scope to that of the raw I/O capabilities
  of the Raspberry Pi platform and provide timely updates and releases for
  bug fixed and new RaspberryPi model introductions.  Reducing the scope of
  the project should better serve the Java community for basic I/O access by
  reducing complexity.

  The following features have been removed from the Pi4J library:

   * IO Expanders:  IO expansion is still supported but concrete
     implementations should be provided outside the core Pi4J core project such
     that they can be maintained and extended independently.

   * Other Platforms:  Other platforms such as Odroid, BananaPi, NanoPi,
     OrangePi, etc. have been removed and will no longer be supported.  The
     challenge with supporting these additional platforms is that Pi4J depends on
     the underlying WiringPi project and WiringPi ports for these other platforms
     is not well supported by the various SoC vendors or community.  The various
     WiringPi ports for these other platforms are also inconsistent causing
     inconsistent features and functionality of Pi4J.  Additionally, regression
     testing of bug fixes and new features in Pi4J is compounded with each
     additional supported platform.

   * Components & Devices:  Pi4J originally provided higher level
     interfaces for components and devices that provided an abstraction
     layer between real world devices (things) and lower-level I/O interfaces.
     While a noble goal, unfortunately this part of the project never received
     the attention and time that it deserved and never gained much adoption
     by the community.  We are removing these to allow Pi4J to focus solely on
     the raw I/O supported by the Raspberry Pi platform.

  New development and bug fixes will now be provided via the 2.0-SNAPSHOT builds and the latest development codebase
  is now maintained in the '{{{https://github.com/Pi4J/pi4j/tree/V2}V2}}' branch.

* Project Status

  Please note that the Version 1.x codebase for this project is no longer being actively developed.  The Version 1.x
  codebase will only be maintained and updated for major bug fixes. This codebase has been largely stable for several
  years and is compatible across a wide variety of Raspberry Pi SoCs and you are welcome to continue using it. However,
  for new projects, it is highly recommended to migrate to the {{{https://v2.pi4j.com/}Pi4J Version 2.x}} codebase.

  Bug fixes are maintained in the '{{{https://github.com/Pi4J/pi4j/tree/master}master}}' branch in
  the Pi4J GitHub repository and SNAPSHOT builds are published in the {{{./download.html#Maven_Repository}Sonatype OSS repository}}.

  Visit the {{{./download.html}Downloads}} page to download the latest Pi4J v1.x library builds.

* Prerequisites

  * {{{https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html}Java 8 JRE/JDK}} - The <<Java 8>> runtime
  environment must be installed and configured on your SoC platform.

  \
  <<ATTENTION:>> \
  If you require a newer Java Virtual Machine for your project, please review the following Pi4J projects:
  {{{https://pi4j.com/1.4}Pi4J v1.4}} or {{{https://v2.pi4j.com/}Pi4J v2.x}}

  * {{{https://github.com/WiringPi/WiringPi}WiringPi}} -The latest WiringPi library must be installed on your RaspberryPi.

  \
  <<ATTENTION:>> \
  The original WiringPi library has been **{{{http://wiringpi.com/wiringpi-deprecated/}DEPRECATED}}** and is no longer maintained.  \
  To support RaspberryPi 4B/400/CM4 and newer systems you must install the latest *unofficial* WiringPi version which is
  maintained here: {{https://github.com/WiringPi/WiringPi}}.\
  <(As of 2021-01-12, this is version 2.60.)>
