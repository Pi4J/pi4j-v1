Pi4J Installation

  The following installation instructions are provided to install, upgrade, and uninstall the Pi4J libraries, examples,
  utility scripts, etc. directly on your Rasbperry Pi.  <<These instructions are not intended to install Pi4J on your
  development workstation or other computer.>>  For development conducted on a computer other than the Raspberry Pi, please
  access the Pi4J JAR dependencies via the {{{./download.html#Maven_Repository}Maven repository}} or
  {{{./download.html#Direct_Download}download}} them directly and reference them in your project.

=====================

* Prerequisites

** Java Runtime (JRE/JDK)

  If you are using a recent build of Raspbian, then an Oracle Java runtime environment is pre-installed.  Nothing more to do.

  If you are using an older Raspbian build that does not already include a Java runtime environment, please see the following article for a complete set of installation instructions for installing the Oracle JDK.\
  {{http://www.savagehomeautomation.com/pi-jdk}}

  <<NOTE:>> As of v1.3, Pi4J requires {{{https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html}Java 8 JRE/JDK}}. The Java 8 runtime
  environment must be installed and configured on your system. \


** WiringPi Native Library

  Pi4J depends on the WiringPi native library originally created by by Gordon Henderson.  Please see the following page for more information on WiringPi. \
  {{http://wiringpi.com/}}

  The Pi4J native library is dynamically linked to WiringPi and thus you must have WiringPi installed on your target Raspberry Pi system.

  <<ATTENTION>>: The original WiringPi library has been **{{{http://wiringpi.com/wiringpi-deprecated/}DEPRECATED}}** and
  is no longer maintained.\
  To support RaspberryPi 4B/400 and newer systems you must install the latest *unofficial*
  WiringPi version which is maintained here: {{https://github.com/WiringPi/WiringPi}}.

  If you have Pi4J installed on your RaspberryPi, you can use the following script command to download, build and
  install the latest <unofficial> build of WiringPi.

----------------------------------------
pi4j --wiringpi
----------------------------------------

  Alternatively, you can use the following shell commands to download, build and install the latest <unofficial>
  build of WiringPi.

----------------------------------------
sudo apt-get remove wiringpi -y
sudo apt-get --yes install git-core gcc make
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/WiringPi/WiringPi --branch master --single-branch wiringpi
cd ~/wiringpi
sudo ./build
----------------------------------------

=====================

* Installation

** Easy/Preferred

  (NOTE: This installation method requires that your RaspberryPi is connected to the Internet.)

  The simplest method to install Pi4J on your RaspberryPi is to execute the following command directly on your RaspberryPi.\
  <<<curl -sSL https://pi4j.com/install | sudo bash>>>

    This method will download and launch an installation script that perform the following steps:

    [[1]] adds the Pi4J APT repository to the local APT repositories

    [[2]] downloads and installs the Pi4J GPG public key for signature validation

    [[3]] invokes the 'apt-get update' command on the Pi4J APT repository to update the local package database

    [[4]] invokes the 'apt-get install pi4j' command to perform the download and installation

** Offline/Manual

  If you prefer/need to install Pi4J on a RaspberryPi device without an Internet connection, the following instructions
  provide the steps necessary to install Pi4J without requiring an Internet connection.

  First, download a copy of the latest Pi4J Debian/Raspian installer package (.deb) file to your local computer.
  You can download the Pi4J Debian/Raspian installer package (.deb) using your web browser at the following URL: \
  {{{https://pi4j.com/download/pi4j-${project.version}.deb}https://pi4j.com/download/pi4j-${project.version}.deb}}

  Next, you will need to transfer the download installer package over to your RaspberryPi.  You can use any method you
  prefer to transfer the file (USB, SCP, FTP, etc.)

  (NOTE: If you have a previous version of Pi4J installed, you will need to  uninstall it first.)

  Once the installer package is available on your RaspberryPi, use the following command on the Pi to perform the installation: \
  <<<sudo dpkg -i pi4j-${project.version}.deb>>>

=====================

* Upgrade

** Easy/Preferred

  If you originally installed Pi4J using the <'easy'> method, then Pi4J upgrades will be available anytime you perform a system
  update using 'sudo apt-get update' and 'sudo update-get upgrade'.

  If you wish to force an upgrade of the Pi4J package only, you can do so by executing the following command: \
  <<<sudo apt-get install pi4j>>> or <<<pi4j --update>>>

** Offline/Manual

  If you originally installed Pi4J using the <'offline'> method, then you will need to manually uninstall the Pi4J package
  and download, transfer, and install the new version package using the 'offline' uninstall and installation methods
  described here on this page.

=====================

* Uninstall

** Easy/Preferred

  If you originally installed Pi4J using the <'easy'> method, then you can uninstall Pi4J simply by executing the
  following command on your RaspberryPi. \
  <<<sudo apt-get remove pi4j>>> or <<<pi4j --uninstall>>>

** Complete/Full Removal

  If you originally installed Pi4J using the <'easy'> method and you want to remove all traces of Pi4J,
  including the Pi4J repository in the APT repositories list and the Pi4J GPG signature, then simply execute the
  following command on your RaspberryPi. \
  <<<curl -sSL https://pi4j.com/uninstall | sudo bash>>>

** Offline/Manual

  If you originally installed Pi4J using the <'offline'> method, then you will need to manually uninstall the Pi4J
  package by executing the following command on your Raspberry Pi: \
  <<<sudo dpkg -r pi4j>>>

=====================

* Installed Location / Example Files

  This will install the Pi4J libraries and example source files to: \
  <<</opt/pi4j/lib>>> \
  <<</opt/pi4j/examples>>>

  When attempting to compile a Java program using the Pi4J libraries, make sure to include the Pi4J lib folder in the classpath: \
  <<<javac -classpath .:classes:/opt/pi4j/lib/'*' ... >>>

  When attempting to start a Java program using the Pi4J libraries, make sure to include the Pi4J lib folder in the classpath: \
  <<<sudo java -classpath .:classes:/opt/pi4j/lib/'*' ... >>>

  If you would like to explore the examples, you can compile all the examples with the following commands: \
  <<</opt/pi4j/examples/build>>>
