Pin Numbering - Raspberry Pi 3 Model B

%{toc|section=0|fromDepth=2|toDepth=3}

* Numbering Scheme

  Pi4J (by default) uses an abstract pin numbering scheme to help insulate software from hardware changes.\
  Pi4J implements the same pin number scheme as the Wiring Pi project.
  More information about the WiringPi pin number scheme can be found here: {{http://wiringpi.com/pins/}}

  Pi4J provides a {{{../apidocs/index.html?com/pi4j/io/gpio/RaspiPin.html}RaspiPin}} enumeration that is used to manage the accessible GPIO pins.

  (NOTE:  Pi4J also can be configured to use the Broadcom Pin numbering scheme.)

  Please see this page for more information on both the WiringPi and Broadcom pin numbering schemes: \
  >> {{{../pin-numbering-scheme.html}Pin Numbering Schemes}}


* Expansion Header

  The Raspberry Pi 3 Model B board contains a single 40-pin expansion header labeled as 'J8' providing access to 28 GPIO pins.\
  (Pins 1, 2, 39 & 40 are also labeled below.)

* J8 Pinout (40-pin Header)

  The diagram below illustrates the GPIO pinout using the Pi4J/WiringPi GPIO numbering scheme.

* Known Issues

  On the Raspberry Pi Model 3B the hardware-based serial/UART device /dev/ttyAMA0 has been re-purposed to
  communicate with the the built-in Bluetooth modem and is no longer mapped to the serial RX/TX pins on the
  GPIO header.  Instead, a new serial port "/dev/ttyS0" has been provided which is implemented with a
  software-based UART (miniUART). This software-based UART ("/dev/ttyS0") does not support PARITY and some
  have experienced some stability issues using this port at higher speeds. If you don't need Bluetooth
  functionality, you can disable the BT modem and configure the RPi to use a device-tree overlay to re-map the
  hardware-based serial UART ("/dev/ttyAMA0") back to the GPIO header pins for TX/RX. See the instructions on
  this page for details on how to configure the device-tree overlay and disable the bluetooth modem/service: \
