Pin Numbering - Raspberry Pi 400

%{toc|section=0|fromDepth=2|toDepth=3}

* Numbering Scheme

  Pi4J (by default) uses an abstract pin numbering scheme to help insulate software from hardware changes.\
  Pi4J implements the same pin number scheme as the Wiring Pi project.
  More information about the WiringPi pin number scheme can be found here: {{http://wiringpi.com/pins/}}

  Pi4J provides a {{{../apidocs/index.html?com/pi4j/io/gpio/RaspiPin.html}RaspiPin}} enumeration that is used to manage the accessible GPIO pins.

  (NOTE:  Pi4J also can be configured to use the Broadcom Pin numbering scheme.)

  Please see this page for more information on both the WiringPi and Broadcom pin numbering schemes: \
  >> {{{../pin-numbering-scheme.html}Pin Numbering Schemes}}


* Expansion Header

  The Raspberry Pi 400 contains a single 40-pin expansion header located on the back of the
  keyboard housing providing access to 28 unique GPIO pins.\

* GPIO Pinout (40-pin Header)

  The diagram below illustrates the GPIO pinout using the Pi4J/WiringPi GPIO numbering scheme.

* Known Issues

  On Raspberry Pi models starting with model 3B (including Raspberry Pi Model 400) the hardware-based
  serial/UART device /dev/ttyAMA0 has been re-purposed to communicate with the the built-in Bluetooth
  modem and is no longer mapped to the serial RX/TX pins on the GPIO header.  Instead, a new serial port
  "/dev/ttyS0" has been provided which is implemented with a software-based UART (miniUART). This
  software-based UART ("/dev/ttyS0") does not support PARITY and some have experienced some stability
  issues using this port at higher speeds. If you don't need Bluetooth functionality, you can disable
  the BT modem and configure the RPi to use a device-tree overlay to re-map the hardware-based serial
  UART ("/dev/ttyAMA0") back to the GPIO header pins for TX/RX. See the instructions on this page for
  details on how to configure the device-tree overlay and disable the bluetooth modem/service: \
